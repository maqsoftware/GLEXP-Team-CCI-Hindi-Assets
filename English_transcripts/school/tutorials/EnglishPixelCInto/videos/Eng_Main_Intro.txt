It's a great big beautiful world. In some places it is really crowded, people rush from place to place. In other places life moves more slowly. Speaking of moving slowly there is my friend tortoise. There are times when it's good to go slowly. Other times speed could be a good thing. The Same is true when you are learning something new. Sometimes ideas are easy to understand and we can learn them quickly. Sometimes we need to take our time. Here you can go by your own pace. Come with me and I will show how to read, write and do maths, all at your own speed.
