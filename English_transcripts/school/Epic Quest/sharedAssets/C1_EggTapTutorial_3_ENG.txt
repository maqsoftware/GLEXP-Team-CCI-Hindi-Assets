Tap the four eggs, that are in the same group as the one at the top of the nest. They could all be the same color. They could all have the same shape on them or they could have the same number of objects on them. If you tap the wrong egg, it will cracked. If you tap all four eggs in the group the checks hatch. See how many chickes you can get before the time runs out. Good luck.
