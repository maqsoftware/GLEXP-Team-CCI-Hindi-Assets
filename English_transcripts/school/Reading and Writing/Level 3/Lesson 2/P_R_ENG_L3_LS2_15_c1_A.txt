A rainy day in may. One day in may it started raining. Rabon sat in his home as it rained and rained, little by little the rain leaked in, so, Ray got a pail to catch the leak, in no time the Pale has filled up so Ray got a bigger pail but then that pail filled up too. Ray waited in vein to rain to stop but it did not.
