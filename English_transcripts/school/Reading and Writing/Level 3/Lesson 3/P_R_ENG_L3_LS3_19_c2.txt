I wish I had a sheep. I wish I had a pet sheep. One day I will get one. I will fix up a shed for my sheep to sleep in. She can share a dish with my cat mush. Each day I will take my sheep to school on a lish. All the kids will want to pet her but they will be too shy to ask. Yes i sure wish i had a sheep. I ask my mom for one once  but instaed she got me a fish. shakss
